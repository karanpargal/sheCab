## Inspiration💡
With expense split apps gaining more and more popularity, we aimed to design an expense split web application that would use blockchain to store the data instead of centralised database.  

## What it does 🧭
On our web-application, a female customer can find a cab to her destination and get a cab with female driver. It increases the saftey measures for women and allow them to travel safely. Also, a female driver can get her ride and earn money.

## How the WebApp Looks 🤜🔥🤛

## How we built it 🔧

On the blockchain side, the booking of cab takes place and payments are handled. This was built using solidity. The smart contract is deployed on polygon mumbai testnet(our first deployment there). On the front end side of things, we built the web app using react.js and tailwind css. 

## Tech Stack 🔨
1. Solidity
2. Smart Contracts
3. React.js
4. Tailwind CSS
5. Hardhat

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️

1. Deployment of smart contract was challenging for us.

2. Integrating the front end app with the backend was difficult for us.

3. We couldn't work around with google api to provide accurate location for the app. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅
1. Successfully deployed smart contract on polygon testnet. 
2. Created a functional web-application. 

## What's next ⏭
 1. We plan to extend this to a mobile application for easier access. 
 2. We plan to add group pooling in the app.
